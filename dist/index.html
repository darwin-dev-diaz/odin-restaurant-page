          <h2>Sancocho</h2>
          <p>
            Sancocho is a traditional food in the Dominican Republic made with
            many kinds of meat with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava

            mazorca.

          <h2>Mofongo</h2>
          <p>
            Mofongo is a popular Dominican dish made with fried green plantains
            mashed by hand together with chicharrones (crispy pork skin) and
            fresh garlic. It's traditionally served with a red shrimp sauce
            (camarones guisados) or chicken broth, and makes for a super
            delicious side

            Mangu, or Dominican mashed plantains – one of Dominicans' most
            beloved dishes, and base of "Los Tres Golpes" – is our gastronomy's
            most complete and complex breakfast

          <h2>Tostones</h2>
          <p>
            A staple dish throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, tostones
            are crisp, flattened plantains that are often served as appetizers
            and side dishes. Unlike sweet maduros, which are made with very
            ripe, almost black, yellow plantains, savory tostones are made with
            unripe green plantains.
